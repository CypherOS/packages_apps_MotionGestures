About the app
-------------

Motion Gestures is a CMActions based application, provided by CyanogenMod.
It offers the same current functionailty and future additions to come.
This is purely a common house for all devices that currently support CMActions,
and an extendable plugin into our own modified Gestures menu for the Settings 
application. This makes it easier for all supported devices to remain up to date,
instead of updating each tree, one by one.
